What is the Movie "Stree 2" About?

"Stree 2" takes us back to the town of Chanderi, years after the events of the first film. The town is plagued by a new terror, Sarkata, a headless ghost who abducts women, dragging them into a nightmarish alternate dimension.

Vicky, along with Rudra and Bittu, must decipher cryptic clues from the Chanderi Puran, an ancient text, to uncover Sarkata's weaknesses. Their journey takes them to Delhi, where they convince Jana, once possessed by Stree, to help them summon her.

However, summoning Stree proves to be a double-edged sword. While she possesses immense power, the townspeople blame Vicky for her initial departure, believing it led to Sarkata's emergence.

Is ‘Stree 2’ Streaming?

No, Stree 2 is not yet available to stream. Stree 2 will eventually be available to stream on Disney+. It was recently reported that the sequel will be given a 100-day window before landing on Disney+. If Stree 2 arrives on Disney+ exactly 100 days after its theatrical release, that would mean the sequel will be made available on September 22, 2024. However, this date is a Sunday, so there is a good chance that the movie will end up on the service a few days before or a few days after said date. Audiences who have yet to subscribe to the streaming platform can choose from two available options.
